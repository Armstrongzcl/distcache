Distcache is a open-source distributed in-memory cache and database.
Operations are mostly asynchronous to achieve high performance.
It is implemented purely in python without any external dependency 
which should make it easier to install and get started with.
One of design goal of this project is ease of use and less cognitive load to users of
similar caching/database systems like Redis, Memcached. The APIs are similar to memcached. 

Since there are no external dependencies, the installation should be pretty straight forward.
This allows you to get started and running real quick.
