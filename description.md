### Distributed Cache

This is project description and list of TODOs.

- (Optional) Implement consistent hashing

- (Optional) Implement health checks

- Deal with unavailable servers like cache miss.
When they come back online again, they will be treated as new servers.

- Spawn servers. The user can provide list of servers to spawn servers there. 
Providing ['localhost','localhost','127.0.0.1'] will spwan three local servers.
