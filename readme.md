### dcache (Distributed Cache)
dcache is a python open-source distributed in-memory cache and database.
Operations are mostly asynchronous to achieve high performance.
It is implemented purely in python without any external dependency.
One of design goal of this project is ease of use and less congitive load to users of
similar caching/database systems like Redis, Memcached.

#### Build and test status
<img src="https://travis-ci.com/wasimusu/dcache.svg?branch=master" width="100">

### Features
- The cache could be on a single PC or multiple PCs scattered over the internet.
- Hardware failure is accounted for
- Cache is available unless all PCs fail
- The API is similar to memcached

# Platform
* Linux
* Python 2.7 to Python 3.5

#### Storage Commands
- set (can be used to update as well, updates the LRU too)
- add
- delete

#### Retrieval Commands
- get
- gets

### TODO
- Add tests
- Add benchmarks

### Install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
- You have multiple servers serving users.
And you need to increment user id across the server such that there is no duplicate.
Similarly you can store product_id, session_id, user_id, etc.
- 80% of the database access is generated by 20% of the queries. You should absolutely not be doing duplicate computations.
Cache the results. And, the figures vary and you can still use caching service. It just makes things faster.
