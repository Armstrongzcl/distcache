### Cached (Distributed Cache)
cached is a python open-source distributed in-memory cache and database.
Operations are mostly asynchronous to achieve high performance.
It is implemented purely in python without any external dependency.
One of design goal of this project is ease of use and less cognitive load to users of
similar caching/database systems like Redis, Memcached.

#### Build and test status
<img src="https://travis-ci.com/wasimusu/dcache.svg?branch=master" width="100">

### Features
- Single server or distributed server cache
- The cache server keeps track of health of cache clients using HealthServer. 
- Cache is available unless all PCs fail
- Logging of key cache operations 
- Log replay or log reconstruction to rebuild cache from log
- The API is similar to memcached
HealthServer regular pings clients to ask if they are alive.

# Platform
* Linux
* Python 2.7 to Python 3.5

#### Cached Commands/functions
- set (can be used to update as well, updates the LRU too)
- delete
- get
- gets

### TODO
- Add tests
- Add benchmarks

### Install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
- You have multiple servers serving users.
And you need to increment user id across the server such that there is no duplicate.
Similarly you can store product_id, session_id, user_id, etc.
- 80% of the database access is generated by 20% of the queries. You should absolutely not be doing duplicate computations.
Cache the results. And, the figures vary and you can still use caching service. It just makes things faster.
